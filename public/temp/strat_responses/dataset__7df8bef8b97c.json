    "reasoning_summary": "The dataset is a regression problem with a moderate size (891 rows) and mixed feature types (7 numeric, 5 categorical). Missing values affect ~8% of the data, so median imputation provides a robust, non\u2011parametric way to fill gaps without discarding rows. One\u2011hot encoding preserves categorical information for tree\u2011based models while avoiding unintended ordinal relationships. Scaling is unnecessary for RandomForest and XGBoost, which are invariant to feature scale. LogisticRegression is omitted because it is primarily a classification algorithm and would be less appropriate for this regression task."
